# Code of Conduct

PythonBiellaGroup is an Italian community with the aim of sharing, disseminating, and delving into programming, the world of software, and technology, specifically focusing on everything related to the Python world.

The community is composed of enthusiasts from the programming world and individuals who simply want to learn, discover new things, and engage in discussions. In order to ensure a stimulating and inclusive environment, we outline the following code of conduct with the goal of providing every community member with the opportunity to find a safe, respectful, and welcoming space, free from harassment or exclusion based on race, gender, political or religious orientations, or other potential discriminatory categories.

Additionally, the code of conduct also contains suggestions on how each member can contribute to making the community a better place through their participation.

## General guide lines

1. The Community's purpose is to learn and deepen knowledge (in all its aspects) of the Python programming language and the world of software and technology. Every member is free to participate in community initiatives as they see fit, always respecting others and allowing room for others' ideas and opinions.

2. Every idea and opinion must be expressed with respect and courtesy, stemming from the respect for human dignity and common living.

3. The most important event for the community is the weekly live meetup where you can attend a talk conducted by a speaker. Every community member is encouraged to ask questions and share their thoughts on the topic discussed. Community members can also volunteer to be speakers for one or more talks.

4. PythonBiellaGroup is not affiliated with any technology vendor; therefore, discussions about any software product are welcome. The community, in any case, supports and encourages the use of open-source software.

5. Community members have different levels of knowledge regarding the topics discussed during discussions, so some subjects may seem obvious or trivial to the more experienced. However, since the group's purpose is to learn together, every discussion should be respected and supported.

6. Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of presentations or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
