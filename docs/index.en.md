# Welcome!

üë®‚Äçüíª **PythonBiellaGroup** is a community dedicated to Python, with the goal of studying and learning the programming language in all its aspects.

## üöÄ Materials
We believe that knowledge should be shared, and that's why we share all the materials (code, notebooks, slides, exercises) that are presented during our meetups on our [GitHub](https://github.com/PythonBiellaGroup), making it accessible to everyone.

Inside, you will find:

* [All the materials used during our meetups](https://github.com/PythonBiellaGroup/MaterialeSerate)
* [Exercises done by the community; propose your solution!](https://github.com/PythonBiellaGroup/Esercizi)
* Community-developed projects:
    - [Bear](https://github.com/PythonBiellaGroup/Bear): a template for a modern python project based on [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
    - [Community website](https://github.com/PythonBiellaGroup/website): website for the community based on [MkDocs](https://mkdocs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
