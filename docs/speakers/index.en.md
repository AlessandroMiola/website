# Do you want to participate as a speaker?

We are always excited to have new speakers to learn new things and allow everyone to share what they have learned during their academic or professional journey.

* Do you have a personal project that you have worked on and would like to share with the community?
* Have you discovered a new Python tool/library that you'd like to talk about?
* Do you have a startup in the IT world and would like to show us what you do?
* Do you have an innovative approach to a specific problem or topic?
