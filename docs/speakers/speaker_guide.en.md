# Guide for the perfect speaker

We have compiled simple guidelines based on feedback from members of the community in live streams or YouTube comments. In general, these are just common-sense tips that enable effective preparation and a good consumption of content during the event.

## **Event preparation**

- Coordinate with the organizers on the topics to be presented.
- Collaborate with the organizers on the evening's presentation text, which will be shared on social media.
- If using slides, if created for this purpose, and if possible, use the "Python Biella Group" templates.

## **Before the event**

### Material

- Arrange the material you will present so that it is easily accessible with just a few clicks.
- Close windows with personal documents or chats to prevent them from accidentally being shared.

### Audio

- Ensure that the microphone is "adequately" close to the mouth.
- Check that the volume is correct.
- Ensure that there are no audio disturbances in the area.

### Video

- It is advisable for the speaker to enable video during the presentation.
- In the case of live coding or presenting code in an IDE, ensure that the font is "adequately" enlarged and that the material is ready.

## **Immediately after the event**

### Share

- Provide the organizers with the possible GitHub link to the presented code.

## **After the event**

### Youtube video

- Once the video is published, report any corrections to the description.

### Answering question from the community

- At least for the first few days after the event and video publication, monitor the comments to respond to any questions.
