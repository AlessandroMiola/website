[Genropy](https://www.genropy.org/) defines a new and original programming paradigm, allowing you to create desktop-like applications in extremely fast times through an integrated solution, from GUI to ORM to deployment. This way, all the necessary tools to create and manage a web app are provided in a simple manner, without the need to know the specific implementation details of the database used (sqlite, postgres, mysql, microsoft sql, and oracle).
The framework is aimed at people who develop and want to create web applications, programming in Python on the server-side and using its syntax on the client-side. This approach enables the rapid creation of user interfaces with minimal use of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The Genropy guys are also very active members of the community! Hurry and take a look at their talks on our channel. [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41M-UL3lZs4&list=PLyaoAB2kb_ZHZbEblU86R6Vttwl-Cplr2&pp=iAQB)
