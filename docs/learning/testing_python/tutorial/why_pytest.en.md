# Why pytest

Pytest serves as a software testing framework, functioning as a command-line utility
that autonomously discovers your written tests, executes them, and
delivers result reports.
It boasts a collection of useful features that can enhance the effectiveness
of your testing.
You can expand its capabilities through the creation of custom plugins
or the installation of third-party ones.
Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with various tools such
as continuous integration and web automation.

## Reasons to use pytest

- Writing simple tests is a breeze with pytest.
- Even intricate tests remain relatively easy to compose.
- The readability of your tests is greatly enhanced.
- Pytest allows for quick and effortless initiation.
- In pytest, assertions are used for verifications, eliminating the need
for constructs like self.assertEqual() or self.assertLessThan().
A simple 'assert' suffices.
- You can use pytest to run tests originally designed for unittest or nose.
- Pytest is actively developed and maintained by a dedicated and
expanding community.
- Its adaptability and flexibility seamlessly integrate with your workflow.
- Since it is separately installed from your Python version,
you can employ the same pytest version across multiple Python
versions.
