## Unittest

Unittest is the very first Python-based automated unit test framework that
was designed to work with the Python standard library.
Supports the reuse of test suits and test organization.
It was inspired by JUnit and supports test automation including test collections,
test independence, setup code for tests, etc.
It is also being called as PyUnit.
Unittest2 is a backport of additional new features added to the Unittest.

## Pytest

PyTest is an open-source Python-based testing framework that is generally all-purpose
but especially for Functional and API testing.
Pip (Package Installer for Python) is required for PyTest installation.
It supports simple or complex text code to test API, databases, and UIs.
Simple syntax is helpful for easy test execution.
Rich plugins and is able to run tests in parallel.
Can run any specific subset of tests.

## Nose2

Nose2 is the successor of Nose and it is a Python-based Unit Testing
framework that can run Doctests and UnitTests.
Nose2 is based on unittest hence it is referred to as extend unittest
or unittest with the plugin that was designed to make testing simple and easier.
Nose uses collective tests from unittest.testcase and supports multiple
functions for writing tests and exceptions.
Nose supports package fixtures, classes, modules, and complex initialization
to be defined at a single time instead of writing frequently.

## Testity

Testify was designed to replace unittest and nose.
Testify has more advanced features over unittest.
Testify is popular as a Java implementation of semantic testing
(Easy to learn and implementing software testing specification).
Performing Automated unit, Integration and System Testing is easier to Testify.
