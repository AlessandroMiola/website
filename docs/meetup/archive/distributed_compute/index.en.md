# Parallel and Distributed Computing in Python

In this series of meetup, we will explore the fundamental concepts of parallel computing, distributed processing, and practical implementation in Python. You will learn how to break down a problem into parallel tasks, coordinate the execution of these tasks across different nodes or processors, and efficiently collect the results.

## Structure of the series

1. Introduction to parallel and distributed computing
2. Parallel and distributed computing: communication between processes
3. Using some Python libraries: Dask, Modin, and Celery
