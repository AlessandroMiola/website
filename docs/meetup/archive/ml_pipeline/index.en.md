# ML Pipeline: Introduction to Pytorch and Hydra

In this two-part series, we will explore two powerful frameworks for managing and implementing a machine learning project.

**PyTorch:**

PyTorch is a popular open-source deep learning framework primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR). PyTorch is known for its flexibility and ease of use, and it is widely used in both academic and industrial settings.

Here are some key features of PyTorch:

1. **Dynamic Tensors**: PyTorch uses dynamic tensors, which means you can define and modify the structure of models during runtime. This makes it well-suited for research and rapid prototyping.

2. **GPU Support**: PyTorch provides excellent support for GPU acceleration, allowing you to perform parallelized intensive computations for faster model training.

3. **Autograd**: PyTorch includes an integrated autograd system that simplifies gradient computation during model optimization.

4. **Large Community and Ecosystem**: PyTorch has a large developer community and a rich collection of libraries and tools for deep learning.

**Hydra:**

Hydra is a flexible and powerful configuration framework that helps developers easily manage configurations for complex projects. It was primarily developed by Facebook and integrates well with PyTorch (and other frameworks).

Here are some key features of Hydra:

1. **Project-Level Configuration**: Hydra allows you to define and manage project configurations hierarchically. You can specify parameters based on the environment (development, testing, production) and easily override configurations.

2. **Configuration Reusability**: Hydra enables you to define detailed configurations once and then reuse them in various project components.

3. **Integration with PyTorch**: Hydra is often used with PyTorch to cleanly and organizedly manage configurations for machine learning models.
