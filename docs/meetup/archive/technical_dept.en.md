## Intro

Every software development project carries a certain level of technical debt with it. But what exactly do we mean by technical debt? What problems does it bring with it? Are there techniques and tools to mitigate it and, if necessary, take corrective actions? We'll answer these questions with Ilaria Pigazzini and Darius Sas from **[Arcan](https://www.arcan.tech/)**.

In the second part, we'll see a concrete example with Python and some live coding.
