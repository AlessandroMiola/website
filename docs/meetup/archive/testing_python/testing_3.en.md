Third meetup of the journey with [Peter Bittner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterbittner/), Python developer and DevOps engineer, in which, hands-on with the code, he shows us how to use doctest to write simple tests and how to use behave for tests understandable by the entire agile team, including project managers.
