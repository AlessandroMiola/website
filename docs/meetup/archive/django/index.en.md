# Django

Here we are for a new journey with the Python Biella Group to discover Django together!

Django is one of the most important web frameworks in Python, which allows you to create web pages and web applications using the model-view-template paradigm.

Our special guest who will accompany us on this journey is Valentino Gagliardi, a freelance consultant, trainer, speaker, and author of the books: "The Little JavaScript Book," "Decoupled Django," "Refactoring to React Hooks."
