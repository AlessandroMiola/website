## Intro

This is the third meetup, during which we continued developing our open-source project Blood Donor. The introduction of new elements into the application provided opportunities for theoretical and practical explanations of various aspects of the framework.

* Live coding Blood Donor (BD) - UI for donor and staff entry (TH UI Resources)
* Live coding BD - Donor card (Tables with 1:N and 1:1 relationships)
* Live coding BD - Customization of the Donator form (central frame and form hook)
* Live coding BD - Customization of the Donator form (the magic of "field")
* Live coding BD - Relative paths
* Live coding BD - Testing and experimentation with test handlers
* Live coding BD - Blood Groups Table (Lookup tables)
* Live coding BD - Donors Table (Formula columns)
