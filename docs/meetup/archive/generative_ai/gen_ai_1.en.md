## Intro

In this session, we delved into Generative AI with a professional from [Data Masters](https://datamasters.it/), Giuseppe Mastrandrea, who guided us through the theory and practice of discovering Large Language Models (LLM).

Topics covered include:

* Introduction to Generative AI and LLM
* Focus on latent spaces, embedding layers, and their training
* Overview and initial experiments with "custom" agents, created by us
