# Data analysis series

A series of four evenings aimed at developing a simple data analysis solution using an open-source dataset (Rome Airbnb Data). The evenings will be hosted by:

* Andrea Melloncelli
* Andrea Guzzo

The purpose of these evenings is to simulate a data analysis process on a specific dataset, working as a team from exploratory analysis to the deployment of an interactive dashboard.
