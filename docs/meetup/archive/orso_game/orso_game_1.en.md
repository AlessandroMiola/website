## Intro

In this meeting, [Mario Nardi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mario-nardi/) talks about the rediscovery of an ancient strategy game found in Forgnengo (a hamlet of Campiglia Cervo, in the Cervo Valley, in the province of Biella), describing the steps that led it from being an engraving on stone to a digital game. And, as you might guess, it was implemented in Python with the contribution of many community members.

Later, we saw how to publish any game developed using PyGame or PyGameZero using the Pygbag helper library.

During the evening, the mini-game "Invasion" was published, which had been developed during the "Learning Python by Programming Games" path:
