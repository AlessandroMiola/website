## Intro

In the first evening, we revisited the history, rules, implementation for two players, and the publication on the web of the Bear Game.
The game is available as a web app on itch.io and does not require any installation: [https://pythonbiella.itch.io/orso](https://pythonbiella.itch.io/orso)

In this meetup, led by Angelo Huang, the focus will be on problem modeling in AI, using the Bear Game as an example.
We will delve into the implementation of AI in the game and the reasoning that has been implemented.
Finally, Angelo will demonstrate the correctness of the algorithm.
