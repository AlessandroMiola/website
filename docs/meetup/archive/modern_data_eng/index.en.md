# Modern data engineering

In this two-meeting journey, we will explore with Davide and Andrea the state of the art in data engineering, with an overview of architectures and an open-source tool for orchestrating data flows: Apache Airflow. In the second part, they present a project they developed with a completely open-source architecture that replicates the characteristics of a modern data engineering solution.

## Structure of the series
