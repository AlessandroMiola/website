## Intro

Polars is a library for data manipulation and processing, highly efficient and incredibly useful in the fields of Data Engineering and Data Science. But how does it really work? Together with [Luca Baggi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucabaggi/), we delved into the vast world of Polars, covering the following topics:

* What is Apache Arrow
* Limitations of Pandas
* Why Polars is efficient
* How Polars works and how to use it
* Demonstrations of using Polars for specific tasks
