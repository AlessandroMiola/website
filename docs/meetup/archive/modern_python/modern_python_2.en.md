## Intro

What are the modern Python tools to ease development? How can you organize a project and which tools can be used to manage various libraries? Would you like to integrate all the modern Python tools by downloading a simple cookiecutter template?

After more than a year from the first "Modern Python" meeting, let's see together with Andrea Guzzo how to use the new Bear cookiecutter template and how to integrate all the modern Python tools for managing dependencies, code, security, and documentation.
