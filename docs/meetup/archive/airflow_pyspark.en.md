## Intro

Apache Airflow is now the most widely used and appreciated open-source orchestration tool in the data world. We will see it in action alongside PySpark in an enterprise context related to the development of AI solutions and data products.

With **Luca Soato**, lead data engineer at **[CARDO AI](https://cardoai.com/)**, we will explore the most interesting features and best practices for getting the most out of this tool.
