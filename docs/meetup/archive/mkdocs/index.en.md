## Intro

In this two-part series, we present MkDocs.

MkDocs is a static website generator, primarily designed for creating documentation using Markdown files. Markdown is a readable markup language that allows you to format text simply using a straightforward and intuitive syntax.

MkDocs greatly simplifies the process of creating and managing documentation, allowing users to focus on content without worrying about the complexity of creating HTML pages or managing layouts. With MkDocs, you can organize documentation in a structure of folders and Markdown files, which will then be automatically converted into HTML pages ready for publication.

The series is curated by [Andrea Guzzo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreaguzzo/) and [Davide Airaghi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/airaghidavide/)
