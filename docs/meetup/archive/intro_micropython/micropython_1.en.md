## Intro

MicroPython is a software implementation of the Python 3 programming language, written in C, optimized for running on microcontrollers.

It's an excellent tool for programming electronic boards, microcontrollers, and realizing projects for makers!

With [Juna Salviati](https://www.linkedin.com/in/junasalviati/), we delved into the world of electronics discussing:

* IoT, Microcontrollers, and Boards
* Introduction to Electronics
* Building a Thermometer
* From Volts to Temperature
* A use case: crop growth prediction
