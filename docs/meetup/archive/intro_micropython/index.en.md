## Intro

MicroPython is a compact and optimized version of Python, designed to run on microcontrollers and embedded devices. It offers a complete and standard-compliant Python implementation on devices with limited resources, such as ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers.

MicroPython has become popular among makers because it allows them to write Python code to control and interact with their electronic devices in a simpler and more intuitive way compared to other more complex programming languages.
