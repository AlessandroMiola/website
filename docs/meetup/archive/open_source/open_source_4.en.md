After the wonderful live interview with Juliana Nicacio, here comes the fourth event to explore the world of Open Source, featuring someone who truly does it! We have with us [Giovanni Barillari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giovannibarillari/), who shares his experience as a contributor and maintainer of several projects, including [Emmett](https://emmet.io) and [Granian](https://github.com/emmett-framework/granian).
