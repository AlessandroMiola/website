In this series of interviews, we will talk about a topic that is particularly close to our hearts: the Open Source world.

* What are the issues and challenges in this realm?
* How to contribute and overcome the fear of "I'm not good enough"?
* How does the role of a "maintainer" work? What are the issues, advantages, and opportunities?
