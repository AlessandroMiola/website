## Intro

After the wonderful live interview with Patrick Arminio, here comes the third event to explore the world of Open Source, featuring someone who really does it! We have with us [Juliana Nicacio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliana-nicacio/?originalSubdomain=it) who will share her experience as a contributor to [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com)!

Let's discover together with Juliana how one can contribute to open source, what the challenges and rewards are.
