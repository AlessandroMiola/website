## Intro

[Luca Gilli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luca-gilli/), CTO and founder of [Clearbox.AI](https://www.clearbox.ai/), provides us with tips on how to make our data pipelines more robust through the writing of unit tests and documentation, using the open-source library great_expectations.

Later on, we delve into what it means to optimize test creation through data profiling, sharing the experience gained during the development of the StructuredDataProfiling library.
