## Intro

Together with [Alessio Stalla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessiostalla/) from [Strumenta](https://strumenta.com/), we will explore how to generate code, that is, how to build a compiler or a transpiler. Starting from the differences between interpreters and compilers and some "fluid" concepts related to them, we will delve into code generation through an example of a Python code generator (high-level). We will see an example of generation through templating and another example through AST, or more precisely, through CST, using the libcst library created and maintained by Instagram.

Alessio is a member of Strumenta, specializing in linguistic engineering services for the creation of DSLs, programming languages, editors, compilers, interpreters, debuggers, and simulators.
