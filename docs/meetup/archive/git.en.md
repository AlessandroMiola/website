## Intro

In this meeting, we will explore one of the most essential and powerful tools in every developer's toolbox: the version control system Git.

Git is the fundamental cornerstone for tracking changes in your source code, collaborating with other developers, and effectively managing software projects. Learning to use Git effectively is crucial for becoming a competent programmer and integrating into development teams.

During this evening, we will guide you through the fundamental concepts of Git. We will begin with an understanding of what version control is and why it is so important. Then, we will examine key Git concepts such as repositories, commits, branches, and merges, and see how to use these tools to track changes in your code.
