## Intro

GPT and Detection System, during this evening, we will try to answer the following questions:

* How does GPT and Chat GPT work? Why are they so important?

* What is the current state of the art, and what are the most important tools?

* How can you identify text generated by an algorithm?

* What methods and techniques?

And much, much more!

Meetup presented by Luca Gilli (Clearbox.ai) and Andrea Guzzo (MDPI).
