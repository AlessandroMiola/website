## Intro

Let's explore the world of Docker, Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, and more together...

During this session, we will cover some simple and advanced theoretical concepts such as networking, storage, images, Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, and much more. Andrea will share his experience as an Architect at Be and how he uses Docker every day for his projects.
We will also see practical examples and a complete microservices-based solution in development.
