## Intro
Second evening on Docker with Andrea Amorosi.
Let's continue exploring the world of Docker, Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, and more together...

During this evening, we will delve into more advanced concepts, and there will be some hands-on and live coding with the project developed for this series of sessions.
We will see how to build the Docker and Docker Swarm architecture for the project, with some live debugging of the Python application.
