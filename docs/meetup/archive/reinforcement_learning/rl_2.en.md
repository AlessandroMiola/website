## Intro

In the second evening with [Alessandro Palmas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandropalmas/), we continue our exploration of the world of Reinforcement Learning, focusing on the [DIAMBRA](https://diambra.ai) environment.
Recording date: 10/03/2022

Alessandro Palmas is an R&D and Innovation Manager in the Aerospace industry, passionate about Reinforcement Learning. He has several years of experience in software development for complex systems, modeling & simulation, machine learning, and is still a co-author of the Packt book "The Reinforcement Learning Workshop."

He is also the creator of "DIAMBRA | Dueling AI Arena," an open-source ecosystem dedicated to Reinforcement Learning that allows testing algorithms with some of the most famous "fighting games" and with an exclusive collection of high-quality interactive environments. He is also involved in developing a proprietary AI Tournaments platform open to coders worldwide, where intelligent algorithms are designed, trained, tested, and made available globally.
